# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Public repository, contributing guide, security policy and issue templates.
- Releases publish automatically when a version tag is pushed.
- SSH backend (no UI yet): hosts from `~/.ssh/config` (with `Include`) and
  `~/.ssh/qutty.conf`, saved hosts written only to the latter, the system `ssh`
  run in a tile with a shared connection (`ControlMaster`), and scp/sftp
  upload, download and directory listing over that connection with progress
  and cancel. A terminal can now run a program other than the login shell.

## 0.1.0 — first release

- Tiling terminal for macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel): every terminal in one
  window.
- Cascade layout: the focused terminal is largest and tiles shrink the longer
  they go unused.
- Seven layout patterns (cascade, spiral, master-stack, columns, rows, grid,
  monocle) with animated transitions; adjustable master ratio and gap.
- Switcher bar, horizontal or vertical, holding the terminals that overflow the
  cluster.
- Adjustable font typeface and size, with detection of installed monospace
  fonts.
- Six color themes, three dark (Sea Glass, Plum, Ember) and three light (Paper,
  Cloud, Sakura), with preview tiles; they switch every terminal live.
- Collapsible Layout, Theme and Fonts sections in the settings panel.
- Keyboard shortcuts for creating, closing, focusing and cycling terminals.
- Honors your macOS key bindings
  (`~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict`) inside the terminal, e.g. a
  ⌘⌫ bound to "delete to start of line".
- Mouse reporting for full-screen programs (vim, tmux, htop), including the
  legacy encoding past column 95.
- Signed with a Developer ID and notarized.
